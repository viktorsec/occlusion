Let $\mathbb{N}$ be a infinite set of positive integers. A $\lambda \textit{-difference set S}$ is a set of positive integers satisfying the property that each positive integer can be expressed as a difference $s - s'$ of elements from $S$  exactly $\lambda$ times.$\cite{presentation}$. In other words, for any set of positive integers $S$, there exists a multiset of differences $D$, containing all differences $s - s'$ if $s > s'$. A frequency sequence $\Lambda$ is then a sequence of which every element $\lambda_i$ is number of appearances of $i$ in multiset $D$. For example, given a set $S = {1,2,3,5}$, $D = {2-1, 3-1, 5-1, 3-2, 5-2, 5-3} = {1,2,4,1,3,2}$ and $\Lambda = {2,2,1,1,0,0,0,...}$. Infinite sequence of zeroes at the end of every frequency sequence of finite set is called $\textit{tail}$ and is often  omitted.

 In this thesis, the main goal will be to study such frequency sequences and implement algorithms to find $\lambda \textit{-difference set S}$ for given frequency sequence.
